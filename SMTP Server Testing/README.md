# SMTP Server Testing script

Basic script I threw together one morning to test different email header combinations with mail servers. Can login to SMTP mailboxes (unencrypted + SSL + STARTTLS) and select both envelope (RFC5321) and message (RFC5322) headers. Used to test "Send As" functionality with Microsoft Exchange Online.
